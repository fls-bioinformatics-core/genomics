"""bowtie_mapping_stats

Extract mapping statistics from a bowtie log file and write to an XLS
spreadsheet, and (optionally) a tab-delimited file.

The mapping statistics can come from either Bowtie or Bowtie2. For
Bowtie the input log file should contain multiple blocks of the form:

Time loading reference: 00:00:01
Time loading forward index: 00:00:00
Time loading mirror index: 00:00:02
Seeded quality full-index search: 00:10:20
# reads processed: 39808407
# reads with at least one reported alignment: 2737588 (6.88%)
# reads that failed to align: 33721722 (84.71%)
# reads with alignments suppressed due to -m: 3349097 (8.41%)
Reported 2737588 alignments to 1 output stream(s)
Time searching: 00:10:27
Overall time: 00:10:27

For Bowtie2 (single end data) the expected input is multiple blocks
of the form:

Multiseed full-index search: 00:20:27
117279034 reads; of these:
  117279034 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    1937614 (1.65%) aligned 0 times
    115341420 (98.35%) aligned exactly 1 time
    0 (0.00%) aligned >1 times
98.35% overall alignment rate
Time searching: 00:21:01
Overall time: 00:21:02

For Bowtie2 (paired end data) the expected input is multiple blocks
of the form:

85570063 reads; of these:
  85570063 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    56052776 (65.51%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    22792207 (26.64%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    6725080 (7.86%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    56052776 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      6635276 (11.84%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    49417500 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      98835000 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        93969575 (95.08%) aligned 0 times
        1622693 (1.64%) aligned exactly 1 time
        3242732 (3.28%) aligned >1 times

In both cases any extraneous lines are ignored.

The program extracts data from the "reads processed"/"reads; of these",
"reads with at least one reported alignment"/"aligned exactly 1 time"",
and "reads that failed to align"/"aligned 0 times" lines for each block,
and then writes these to an output XLS file.

The program depends upon the simple_xls module, and the 3rd party
Python modules xlwt, xlrd and xlutils.
